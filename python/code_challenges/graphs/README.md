# Graphs

## Code Challenge 35

### **Feature Tasks**

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

&nbsp;

- **add node**
  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: The added node
  - Add a node to the graph

&nbsp;

- **Add a node to the graph**
  - Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
  - Returns: nothing
  - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
  - If specified, assign a weight to the edge
  - Both nodes should already be in the Graph

&nbsp;

- **get nodes**
  - Arguments: node
  - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
    - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

&nbsp;

- **size**
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
